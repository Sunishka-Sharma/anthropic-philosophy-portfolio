  <h1>Philosophy Papers for Anthropic</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Academic Portfolio in Philosophy, AI Ethics, and Cognitive Systems (2020-2024)</p>
</div>

This collection represents my philosophical and empirical research on AI ethics, algorithmic accountability, behavioral evaluation, and technological impact. My work directly addresses many of Anthropic's core concerns: **designing AI systems that demonstrate good judgment, align with human values, and respond appropriately across diverse scenarios**.

  <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
  
  <p class="lead-paragraph">My academic work explores the intersection of philosophy, ethics, cognitive science, and emerging technology. I draw from sociological theory, epistemology, psychology, and normative frameworks to address pressing questions about AI behavior, judgment, and alignment with human values.</p>
  
  <div class="anthropic-relevant">
    <h4>Relevance to Model Behavior Architecture</h4>
    <p>My interdisciplinary background uniquely positions me to evaluate subtle model behaviors and design prompting strategies that enhance AI judgment. By combining rigorous philosophical analysis with empirical cognitive science research, I've developed frameworks for assessing AI outputs against human ethical standards and expectations.</p>

    <h3>Interdisciplinary Research Experience</h3>
    <div class="experience-grid">
      <div class="experience-entry">
        <h4>Cognitive Science Lab</h4>
        <p class="experience-subtitle">Deep Learning for Neuropsychiatry and ADHD Diagnosis (2021-2022)</p>
        <p>As a researcher in the Cognitive Science Lab, I contributed to cutting-edge work at the intersection of AI, psychology, and neuroscience. Our team developed deep learning models to identify patterns in neurological data for ADHD diagnosis, requiring nuanced analysis of behavioral markers and cognitive processing patterns.</p>
        <p>This experience directly informs my approach to AI alignment by providing empirical grounding in how cognitive and behavioral patterns can be modeled, measured, and evaluated. Key insights from this work that translate to AI behavior architecture include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pattern Recognition in Complex Behavioral Data</strong> - Identifying subtle behavioral cues that indicate underlying cognitive processes</li>
          <li><strong>Rigorous Evaluation Methodologies</strong> - Designing testing frameworks that account for context-dependent behavior variations</li>
          <li><strong>Ethical Considerations in Automated Analysis</strong> - Balancing accuracy with normative considerations around bias, fairness, and autonomy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My philosophical work on AI ethics is deeply enriched by this hands-on experience with neural processing systems, providing practical insights into how computational models can reflect, predict, and influence human behavior.</p>

## Academic Background

<div class="academic-section">
  <h3>Philosophy & Psychology Training</h3>
  <p>My academic preparation combines <strong>formal philosophical training</strong> with <strong>empirical research in cognitive science</strong>. This interdisciplinary background has equipped me with both the theoretical frameworks to analyze ethical issues in AI and practical experience evaluating cognitive and behavioral patterns.</p>
  
  <p>I enrolled in <strong>every philosophy elective offered at IIIT-Delhi</strong> and received a <strong>perfect GPA (10/10)</strong> in all of them. These courses were taught by scholars with active research in ethics, philosophy of technology, and political theory. Additionally, my work in the <strong>Cognitive Science Lab</strong> provided hands-on experience with psychological and neurological data analysis.</p>
  
  <p>This dual training in philosophical reasoning and empirical methods aligns perfectly with the requirements for evaluating and enhancing language model behavior, where both normative reasoning and empirical evaluation are essential.</p>
