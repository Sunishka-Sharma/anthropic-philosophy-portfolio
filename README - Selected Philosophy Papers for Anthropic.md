# **README – Selected Philosophy Papers for Anthropic**

These papers were written between 2020–2024 during my undergraduate coursework in philosophy and AI ethics at IIIT-Delhi. Each explores topics related to value alignment, model behavior, and algorithmic accountability. I’ve selected these as part of my application to Anthropic’s Model Behavior Architect role. For questions about authorship or academic context, feel free to reach out directly.

## **🔥 CORE PORTFOLIO** 

### **1\. Algorithmic Accountability and Public Reason: A Critical Analysis**

📅 Second Year (Spring 2021\) — Response Paper  
 🧠 Novelty: Challenges a cutting-edge governance proposal; critiques Reuben Binns' use of Rawlsian "public reason" in AI.  
 ✍️ Description: Engages deeply with Binns’ framework, summarizing and critiquing his argument for public reason in algorithm design. The paper argues that “public reason” relies on contested assumptions, questioning its feasibility in practice. Thoughtfully challenges whether consensus-driven governance is realistic for AI alignment.

📅 Second Year (Spring 2021\) — Case Study  
 🧠 Novelty: Applies Brey’s disclosive ethics to algorithmic incentives in the YouTube recommender system—a rare methodological application.  
 ✍️ Description: Investigates how YouTube’s engagement-optimizing algorithm incentivizes exploitative family vlogs. Applies a two-stage disclosive analysis to reveal the platform’s hidden value priorities. Highlights algorithmic harm to vulnerable users and draws powerful analogies to child labor law.

## 🎓 Coursework Distinctions in Philosophy

I enrolled in **every philosophy elective offered at IIIT-Delhi** and received a **perfect GPA (10/10)** in all of them. These courses were taught by scholars with active research in ethics, philosophy of technology, and political theory.

Notably, IIIT-Delhi uses a **relative, weighted GPA system** — meaning GPA is not awarded based on absolute marks but on comparative performance. In these philosophy courses, **only 2-3 students** (myself included) received a GPA of 9 or above. I took these electives **alongside Master’s and PhD students**, many of whom had extensive backgrounds in philosophy or the social sciences.
