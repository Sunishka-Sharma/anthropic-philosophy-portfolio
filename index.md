  <p class="subtitle">Academic Portfolio in Philosophy and AI Ethics (2020-2024)</p>
</div>

This collection represents my philosophical research on AI ethics, algorithmic accountability, and technological impact, written during my undergraduate studies at IIIT-Delhi from 2020–2024. These papers have been selected for their relevance to Anthropic's mission of building AI systems that are safe, interpretable, and aligned with human values.

## Academic Background

<div class="academic-section">
  <h3>Philosophy Coursework</h3>
  <p>I enrolled in <strong>every philosophy elective offered at IIIT-Delhi</strong> and received a <strong>perfect GPA (10/10)</strong> in all of them. These courses were taught by scholars with active research in ethics, philosophy of technology, and political theory.</p>
  
  <p>Notably, IIIT-Delhi uses a <strong>relative, weighted GPA system</strong> — meaning GPA is not awarded based on absolute marks but on comparative performance. In these philosophy courses, <strong>only two students</strong> (myself included) received a GPA of 9 or above. I took these electives <strong>alongside Master's and PhD students</strong>, many of whom had extensive backgrounds in philosophy or the social sciences.</p>
